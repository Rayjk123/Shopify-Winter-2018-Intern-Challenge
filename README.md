A Swift application to solve the mobile problem set in this code
The project was written entirely in Swift and did not use the storyboard which would have simplified things but would
also have made it harder to share and collaborate with others. 

## Problem Space
You're a successful Shopify merchant! You've been busy promoting your store, and in the whirlwind of marketing, dealing with suppliers, and shipping ordersâ€”you've completely forgotten to run some reports on your latest orders. Create a mobile app that calculates and displays the following data:
The amount (in Canadian dollars) spent by Napoleon Batz, one of your favourite customers!
The number of Awesome Bronze Bags that have sold (total quantity)

You can access your orders with this link:

## Installing
'git clone' the file and open the *.xcodeproj file

## Running
Run it on any simulator but I personally ran it on iPhone 6s.
